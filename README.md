# Speaker-Verification

### Introduction
Speaker verification is the task of determining whether a given audio sample belongs to a specific speaker or not. It is widely used in security systems, voice assistants, and other applications. In this project, I explore the use of Siamese networks for speaker verification. I convert audio data into spectrograms, create positive and negative pairs, and train a Siamese network for this task.

### Problem Statement
Speaker verification is a critical component in voice-based authentication systems. Traditional methods often rely on complex feature engineering and require a substantial amount of labeled data for training. Siamese networks offer an alternative approach that can learn speaker verification tasks with limited labeled data.

### Solution
A Siamese network consists of two identical neural networks (twin networks) with shared weights. It learns to differentiate between pairs of inputs. In speaker verification, we can use Siamese networks to learn a similarity metric between spectrogram representations of audio samples. Positive pairs contain spectrograms from the same speaker, while negative pairs contain spectrograms from different speakers.

### Implementation
1. Audio to Spectrogram Conversion
Convert the audio samples into spectrograms, which provide a visual representation of the audio data's frequency content over time. Spectrograms capture important features for speaker verification.
2. Dataset Creation
Create positive pairs: Pairs of spectrograms from the same speaker.
Create negative pairs: Pairs of spectrograms from different speakers.
3. Siamese Network Architecture
Build a Siamese network architecture with shared twin networks. Each network typically consists of LSTM layers followed by a dense layer.
The network learns to map the input spectrograms into a common feature space where similarity can be measured. And then dot product is taken with feature vectors which can be passed through a sigmoid activation to classify audio signals.
4. Training
Train the Siamese network using the created pairs of spectrograms.
5. Testing
For testing, create similar pairs containing spectrograms from the same or different speakers.
Feed these pairs into the trained Siamese network and which will classify them as similar or dissimilar.
6. Evaluation
Measure the accuracy of the Siamese network in correctly identifying similar and dissimilar pairs.
Results
In my experiments, I achieved a 74% accuracy using a Siamese network with 2 LSTM layers and 1 dense layer for speaker verification. The specific architecture and hyperparameters may vary depending on the dataset and the complexity of the task. Fine-tuning and further optimization could potentially improve performance.

### Conclusion
Siamese networks offer an effective approach to speaker verification, especially in scenarios with limited labeled data. By training on pairs of spectrograms representing audio samples, these networks can learn to distinguish between speakers accurately. This project demonstrates the feasibility of using Siamese networks for speaker verification tasks and highlights the potential for further improvements in accuracy with additional optimization and data.

### Future Work
In future work, you can explore the following areas:

Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tune the Siamese network's architecture and hyperparameters to achieve better performance.
Transfer Learning: Consider using pre-trained models or transfer learning to leverage large-scale audio datasets.
Real-time Verification: Optimize the model for real-time speaker verification applications.
Security Considerations: Explore techniques to enhance the security of the speaker verification system to prevent spoofing attacks.
